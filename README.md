# _Epicodus Independent Project - March 6, 2020_

#### By _**Brandan Sayarath**_

## Description

This is the Epicodus independent end-of-week assignment for Friday, March 6, 2020.  The purpose of this assignment is to create a console application that gathers both a word and sentence from a user, then checks how frequently the word appears in the sentence.  This application will only check for exact matches.  For instance, if provided the word "cat" and sentence "I'm walking to the cathedral." the first three letters of the word cathedral would not be counted.
